## How to use

Just run the code, paste the URL of any YouTube video when prompted, and wait a few moments. Your download will appear in whatever folder you specify in the download function.

Hint: edit line "youtube_music.download("/this/is/where/your/download/goes")"

Alternatively, leave .download() blank and your audio files will appear in the same folder that main.py is located.

### Why did I make this?
''
I often code in public places where there is no or limited wifi connectivity and find it hard to concentrate without some good music to drown out the noise. I didn't want to shell out $12 for YT Red nor risk getting a virus by downloading from a website. So, I made this little program.

The download speeds are somewhat slower than ideal. But that may be due to my old wifi card. Perhaps others will find the download rate acceptable when using newer computers.
